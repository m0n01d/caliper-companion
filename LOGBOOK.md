# Caliper Companion — LOGBOOK

Running log of decisions, judgment calls, and hand-off state. Newest entry last.

## 2026-09-17 — v0 build kicked off

- Repo scaffolded from the v0 spec (`SPEC.md`). Stack: ReScript 12.3 + @rescript/react 0.15 +
  React 19, Vite 8, PouchDB 9 + pouchdb-find, fflate, vitest for `core/`, Playwright for e2e.
  Versions match ternpike where ternpike has the package (rescript, vite, playwright, pouchdb).
- Ternpike is Elm with PouchDB in plain-JS glue (`src/pouch.js`) and no React, so "copy the PouchDB
  bindings" became: port the doc/index/attachment patterns from `pouch.js` into typed ReScript
  `external` bindings (`src/bindings/PouchDb.res`). The PWA scaffold (manifest, `sw.js`, the Vite
  SW-stamping plugin, `index.html` meta) is copied nearly verbatim.
- Judgment call: no Tailwind. Ternpike's theme tokens are copied into plain CSS custom properties
  (`src/theme.css`) so the dependency list stays at what the spec allows.
- Judgment call: unit tests are written in ReScript (`*Test.res`) with a thin vitest binding and run
  by vitest on the compiled `.res.mjs`. Tests in raw JS would have to know ReScript's runtime
  representation of variants, which is brittle.
- TEA: `src/app/Tea.res` is a ~60-line Elm-architecture runtime over React (single model, `msg`
  variant, `update: (model, msg) => (model, cmd)`, pure `view`). Pages follow the elm-spa layout:
  one module per screen with its own `model`/`msg`/`init`/`update`/`view`; `Main.res` composes.
- Blocking open question from SPEC §13 (mm-only in v0 with inch as a display toggle) is unanswered;
  building the spec as written (units on the part, inch parsing for fractions) since that's what
  the acceptance criteria test.

## 2026-09-17 — M2 (persistence) landed on `agent/m2-store`

- `src/bindings/PouchDb.res`, `Ids.res`, `Clock.res`, and `src/store/Store.res`/`.resi` +
  `src/store/tests/StoreTest.res`. `npx rescript build` clean, `npx vitest run` 13/13 green
  (12 Store tests + the pre-existing SmokeTest). M1 (`core/`) hadn't landed yet when this started,
  so `Slug` wasn't available — `Store.createPart` takes `~slug` from the caller instead of deriving
  it, per the task's own note.
- Attachments are the real finding here: this repo's `pouchdb` package resolves to its Node/LevelDB
  build under vitest, and that build has **no Blob support at all** for inline `_attachments` —
  `binaryMd5` hashes the attachment data with Node's `crypto`, which throws on a `Blob`
  (`ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE`), and its own source comment says "In Node, we store the buffer directly."
  The one payload shape PouchDB accepts identically in the browser build and this Node build is a
  base64 string, so `Store.putFace` converts the given `PouchDb.blob` (a real `Blob` — that part of
  the SPEC's suggested `@new external makeBlob: array<Uint8Array.t> => blob = "Blob"` shape is
  right, and it's what the browser side will hand in from a canvas `toBlob()` later) via
  `PouchDb.blobToBase64` before the atomic `put`. Reading back is the mirror problem —
  `getAttachment` returns a `Buffer` on Node (no `.size`) and a `Blob` in the browser — normalized
  through `PouchDb.blobOfRaw`, which passes either through `new Blob([raw])` (a `Buffer` is a valid
  Blob part; so is an existing `Blob`). All verified live against the actual installed `pouchdb`
  package, not assumed from docs — see the comments in `PouchDb.res`'s attachments section.
- `pouchdb-find`'s query planner couldn't sort by `updatedAt` even with an explicit `use_index`
  naming the exact `[type, updatedAt]` compound index (`Cannot sort on field(s) "updatedAt" when
  using the default index`, reproduced standalone against the installed package). `ensureIndexes`
  still creates both required indexes, but every Store read path (`listParts`, `facesOf`,
  `dimensionsOf*`) uses `allDocs` id-prefix range scans + in-memory filter/sort instead of `find` —
  the same pattern ternpike's `pouch.js` already uses for `expense::` ids. Plenty fast at this app's
  single-user scale; revisit if `find()`'s planner behaves differently on a later pouchdb-find.
- ReScript 12.3 compiler gotcha (not a design choice, cost real time to isolate): a `.res` function
  *definition* with an explicit inline type annotation on an optional labeled argument
  (`~adapter: string=?`) — even completely unused in the body — trips an internal parser bug
  ("We've found a bug for you!", the arg gets typed as `string` instead of `option<string>`).
  Reproduced in isolation with no record punning involved. Fix: drop the inline annotation in the
  `.res` (`~adapter=?`) and let it unify against the `.resi`'s declared type, which is unaffected —
  the bug is specific to the implementation-site pattern, not the signature-position syntax.
