# Caliper Companion — LOGBOOK

Running log of decisions, judgment calls, and hand-off state. Newest entry last.

## 2026-09-17 — v0 build kicked off

- Repo scaffolded from the v0 spec (`SPEC.md`). Stack: ReScript 12.3 + @rescript/react 0.15 +
  React 19, Vite 8, PouchDB 9 + pouchdb-find, fflate, vitest for `core/`, Playwright for e2e.
  Versions match ternpike where ternpike has the package (rescript, vite, playwright, pouchdb).
- Ternpike is Elm with PouchDB in plain-JS glue (`src/pouch.js`) and no React, so "copy the PouchDB
  bindings" became: port the doc/index/attachment patterns from `pouch.js` into typed ReScript
  `external` bindings (`src/bindings/PouchDb.res`). The PWA scaffold (manifest, `sw.js`, the Vite
  SW-stamping plugin, `index.html` meta) is copied nearly verbatim.
- Judgment call: no Tailwind. Ternpike's theme tokens are copied into plain CSS custom properties
  (`src/theme.css`) so the dependency list stays at what the spec allows.
- Judgment call: unit tests are written in ReScript (`*Test.res`) with a thin vitest binding and run
  by vitest on the compiled `.res.mjs`. Tests in raw JS would have to know ReScript's runtime
  representation of variants, which is brittle.
- TEA: `src/app/Tea.res` is a ~60-line Elm-architecture runtime over React (single model, `msg`
  variant, `update: (model, msg) => (model, cmd)`, pure `view`). Pages follow the elm-spa layout:
  one module per screen with its own `model`/`msg`/`init`/`update`/`view`; `Main.res` composes.
- Blocking open question from SPEC §13 (mm-only in v0 with inch as a display toggle) is unanswered;
  building the spec as written (units on the part, inch parsing for fractions) since that's what
  the acceptance criteria test.

## 2026-09-17 — M6 app shell (agent/app-shell)

- **PWA scaffold**: `public/manifest.json`, `public/sw.js`, `index.html` head meta ported from
  ternpike almost verbatim, minus the Cloudflare analytics beacon and the no-cache meta tags (this
  app wants its shell cached, not defeated). `sw.js` additionally drops ternpike's `SKIP_CACHE`
  host allowlist and the `push`/`notificationclick` listeners per the brief — v0 makes no network
  calls of its own (SPEC §5) so there's nothing to skip, and no push feature exists to receive for.
  Kept: atomic critical precache (`addAll`), two-generation cache retention on activate,
  `SKIP_WAITING`/`GET_VERSION` messages, network-first fetch with a cached-shell fallback for
  navigations.
- **Icons are ternpike's, unchanged placeholders** (`icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`,
  `apple-touch-icon.png`, `favicon.svg`) — Caliper Companion has no art yet. Whoever designs the
  real mark should replace these four files; nothing else references their content.
- **Judgment call — no Google Fonts.** ternpike's `global.css` `@import`s Playfair
  Display/DM Mono/Crimson Pro from `fonts.googleapis.com`. SPEC §5 says v0 makes no network calls,
  and pulling a stylesheet from Google's CDN on every cold load is a network call the offline-shell
  criterion (M6) would then depend on. `theme.css` keeps the same three `--font-*` family-name
  stacks (so the look ports forward if fonts are vendored later) but falls through to system
  serif/mono today. No new dependency, no CDN fetch, and the SW's fetch handler stays simple
  (no cache-first branch for `fonts.googleapis.com`/`fonts.gstatic.com` — there's nothing to fetch).
- **Judgment call — no Tailwind, no `html.dark`.** Per the brief, `theme.css` is `:root` custom
  properties instead of a Tailwind `@theme` block, carrying over only the palette/fonts/radii/
  shadows tokens (not ternpike's grain texture, topo-atlas backgrounds, or keyframe animations,
  which are ternpike-specific decoration). Dropped ternpike's `html.dark` night-mode remap entirely
  — SPEC never asks for a dark theme and there's no toggle UI to drive it; can be ported later if
  wanted.
- **Route.res**: `t = Parts | Part(string) | Capture(string) | Annotate(string, string) | Settings
  | Debug`, hash-based (`#/`, `#/parts/:id`, …), unknown/malformed hashes fall back to `Parts`
  (no 404 page in v0). `push`/`subscribe` both go through `Tea.effect`, so routing has no
  special-cased side-effect path outside the TEA runtime.
- **A2hsHint is a plain React component, not a TEA page** (see its own header comment for the
  reasoning) — its whole state is one derived boolean computed once at mount from platform checks,
  plus a dismiss action that never needs to round-trip through `update`. Uses `localStorage`
  (key `cc.a2hsHintShown`) rather than the Store, per the brief: the shell must not depend on
  `src/store/*`, which doesn't exist yet (a later agent owns it).
- **Shell's back button calls `Tea.run(Route.push(route), ...)` directly** rather than going
  through a page's `dispatch` — it's chrome, not a page, and doesn't have one. Setting
  `location.hash` fires `hashchange`, which `Main`'s `Route.subscribe` turns into `RouteChanged`,
  so the round trip back into the TEA loop happens automatically.
- **No `position: fixed` anywhere** (SPEC §5: the keyboard resizes the viewport and breaks fixed
  toolbars). `.app-frame` is a `100dvh` flex column with `.shell` (flex: 1, internally scrolling)
  and `.a2hs-hint` as flex siblings, so the hint docks to the bottom of the viewport without
  `position: fixed`. `.sheet` (for the future annotate reading-input panel) is `position: absolute`
  within its own page container, sized off `--vv-height`, a CSS var `Index.res` keeps live from a
  `visualViewport` `resize` listener.
- **e2e config bug found and fixed**: Playwright resolves `webServer.command`'s cwd to the config
  file's own directory (`e2e/`) by default, not the invocation cwd. `vite preview` run from `e2e/`
  binds the port fine but serves 404s for everything (`e2e/dist` doesn't exist), and the webServer
  health check then times out waiting for a response it's never going to get — no useful error
  message, just `Timed out waiting 60000ms from config.webServer.`. Fixed by setting
  `webServer.cwd` explicitly to the repo root (`fileURLToPath(new URL('..', import.meta.url))`).
  `testDir`/`outputDir` have the same config-relative-path behavior and are set accordingly
  (`'specs'`, `'.results'`, not `'e2e/specs'`).
- **Real sw.js bug found by the offline e2e test, fixed in `public/sw.js`**: the offline-reload
  test was intermittently failing (`net::ERR_FAILED` on the hashed JS/CSS, page never renders) —
  not a test flake, a genuine cache-miss. `vite preview`/`vite dev` serve every asset with `Vary:
  Origin` (Vite's `cors: true` default). `install`'s `caches.addAll(...)` fetches those URLs
  *from inside the worker*, with no `Origin` header; the page's own tags fetch them *with* one
  (Vite emits `crossorigin` on the built `<script type="module">`/`<link rel="stylesheet">`).
  `Cache.match()` honors `Vary` by default, so it compares the `Origin` header of the live request
  against the one recorded for the cached response — no match, byte-identical URL or not — and the
  fetch handler falls through to `Response.error()`. Fixed by matching with `{ignoreVary: true}`
  (both the direct match and the `'/'` shell fallback); confirmed with a 15-run repro loop before
  and after. Worth carrying this same `ignoreVary` fix into ternpike's `sw.js` if it hasn't already
  hit the same bug there — nothing here is Caliper-Companion-specific, it's a Vite-preview-plus-
  Cache-API interaction.
- **WebKit cannot launch in this sandbox** — missing GTK4/graphene/gstreamer/flite shared
  libraries (full list in `e2e/README.md`). The `webkit` project stays defined; per the brief,
  nothing was apt-installed and the project wasn't deleted. All three specs pass on `chromium`;
  the offline-launch test explicitly skips on anything but `chromium`
  (`test.skip(browserName !== 'chromium', ...)`) since the SW mechanics it checks are
  engine-agnostic. SPEC's real target for the iOS-specific rules (§5, §10) is WebKit, though —
  that suite still needs a real run on a Mac or a Linux host with the WebKit deps before trusting
  iOS-specific behavior (viewport, safe-area, `navigator.standalone`).
- Verified clean: `npx rescript build` (26 modules, `warnings.error = "+a"`, zero warnings),
  `npm run build` (`dist/sw.js` stamped with a real `CACHE` version and `PRECACHE_URLS`),
  `npm test` (existing `SmokeTest` still green — nothing in `src/core` touched), `npm run e2e`
  (3/3 passing on chromium, 3/3 failing to *launch* — not fail assertions — on webkit).
