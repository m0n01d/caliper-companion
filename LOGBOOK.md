# Caliper Companion — LOGBOOK

Running log of decisions, judgment calls, and hand-off state. Newest entry last.

## 2026-09-17 — v0 build kicked off

- Repo scaffolded from the v0 spec (`SPEC.md`). Stack: ReScript 12.3 + @rescript/react 0.15 +
  React 19, Vite 8, PouchDB 9 + pouchdb-find, fflate, vitest for `core/`, Playwright for e2e.
  Versions match ternpike where ternpike has the package (rescript, vite, playwright, pouchdb).
- Ternpike is Elm with PouchDB in plain-JS glue (`src/pouch.js`) and no React, so "copy the PouchDB
  bindings" became: port the doc/index/attachment patterns from `pouch.js` into typed ReScript
  `external` bindings (`src/bindings/PouchDb.res`). The PWA scaffold (manifest, `sw.js`, the Vite
  SW-stamping plugin, `index.html` meta) is copied nearly verbatim.
- Judgment call: no Tailwind. Ternpike's theme tokens are copied into plain CSS custom properties
  (`src/theme.css`) so the dependency list stays at what the spec allows.
- Judgment call: unit tests are written in ReScript (`*Test.res`) with a thin vitest binding and run
  by vitest on the compiled `.res.mjs`. Tests in raw JS would have to know ReScript's runtime
  representation of variants, which is brittle.
- TEA: `src/app/Tea.res` is a ~60-line Elm-architecture runtime over React (single model, `msg`
  variant, `update: (model, msg) => (model, cmd)`, pure `view`). Pages follow the elm-spa layout:
  one module per screen with its own `model`/`msg`/`init`/`update`/`view`; `Main.res` composes.
- Blocking open question from SPEC §13 (mm-only in v0 with inch as a display toggle) is unanswered;
  building the spec as written (units on the part, inch parsing for fractions) since that's what
  the acceptance criteria test.
